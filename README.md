# Matrix-terminal

This is a small project which remakes the old terminal screensaver from the 1999 Action/Sci-Fi movie : The Matrix for the windows command line which is also inspired by the cmatrix command in linux.

The screen is also responsive to resizing.

To quit the termianl just press 'q'.
